# Data Consumers

Data Consumers pay for access to DLPs and user-owned data apps within the ecosystem. They create demand for data contribution and ecosystem growth.

## **Participation**

* Provide demand for DLP creation and data collection.
* Pay fees to access DLP data banks for external services.
* Propose ideas and data needs to DLP Creators.

We expect big tech companies will fill the role of Data Consumers and request access to niche data on the Vana network (if the users allow) to push the frontiers of their models. We also expect the Vana architecture to enable new model creators to finance and aggregate data for their projects.
