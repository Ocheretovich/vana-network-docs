# Data Liquidity Layer

The Data Liquidity Layer is where data is contributed, validated, and recorded to the network into data liquidity pools (DLPs). Here, DLP creators deploy DLP smart contracts with specific data contribution objectives, including the DLPâ€™s purpose, validation method, and data contribution parameters.

In the Data Liquidity Layer, data contributors and custodians submit data to DLPs for validation and receive both governance rights and rewards for their data contributions based on parameters set out in the DLP validation process.

The purpose of the Data Liquidity Layer is to bring data onchain and facilitate data transactions among Data Contributors, Custodians, and DLP Validators. This network layer organizes all data collection and management for user and developer accessibility throughout the ecosystem.
